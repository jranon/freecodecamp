1.	5/29/17 - Created basic layout.  Set display initializations.  Set button click functions.

2.  5/30/17 - Set clock click function to set a 1 second interval function.  Need to figure out how to handle switching between the session and break timers - reset time variable to session/break's initial value when time number ticks down to zero.
